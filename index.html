        <ul>
         <li>Patience: One of the biggest keys to getting anything done right. Spending hours with different people trying to figure
         out a wide range of different problems has given me the ability to easily sit through and push until whatever the problem is,
         it will be solved.</li>
            
         <li>Attentiveness: A second but still very important trait, one that gives a person the level head it takes to listen to so
         many different complaints and questions, but to fufill your role as an employee is a must, just like a programmer would recieve
         requests from clients that the must fufill.</li>
            
         <li>Clear communication skills: As an employee, talking about your own life to customers is a big no-no. Even for programmers, 
         they must be able to draw the line on when it is time to work and when they can ramble on about their home lives.</li>
            
         <li>Knowledge: There is nothing more bothersome to anyone than an uninformed employee, the same goes for programmers, should
         they not be able to understand what their client requests, that would be a huge waste of money and time. To be well informed
         is to be the best possibly help to the customer/client.</li>
            
         <li>Ability to use positive language: It may not seem like a big deal at first, but some sales are made or not made specifically
         beacause of what the customer was told. Should they be told something that gives them a poor impression of your company, they
         may just choose the competitor, and vice versa. </li>
            
         <li>Time management skills: This is one of the biggest parts to being in any working situation, running out of time on anything
         always has more cost than it would be worth. This is why being able to manage time well enough to work on multiple projects at
         once is key. As an employee, you run around constantly doing different things, but you are never expected to forget about
         any previous task.</li>
